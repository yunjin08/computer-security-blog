This is the **lead post** for this week. The main body is written in Markdown.

You can use normal paragraphs, **bold**, *italic*, lists, and so on. Images in the same week folder can be referenced by path, e.g. `hero.jpg` for the hero image.

More content follows below. The design uses this as the large feature article with the big headline and hero image.

## Section heading

You can add more sections. Each week folder can have multiple `.md` files; use `index.md` as the feature post and others will appear in the sidebar or list.
